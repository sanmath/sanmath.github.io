## Master Thesis
Here you can find a copy of my master thesis. I worked on the computation of Value at Ruin and Tail Value at Ruin. Both risk measures were commputed considering the Cr√°mer Lundberg Risk Process con Heavy Tailed Claim amounts and Light Tailed claim amounts. IN order to compute such measures, it was necessary to use stochastic simulation techniques.
