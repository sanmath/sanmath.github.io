In have created this website to publish some topics about my professional interest as statistics, actuarial mathematics, R programming, data visualization, also I want to share some of the knowledge that I have been adquiring during my short experience, as a student and in my job. If you have questions about my work, or everything related to me, do not hesitate in contact me.

I have added this link where you can find my CV as a pdf document.

## My Interests

Just for hobbie, I like to plot anything using R.

```{r,echo=FALSE,results=TRUE,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,fig.align='center'}
a1<-rep(x = "Actuarial Mathematics",23)
a2<-rep(x = "Statistics",12)
a3<-rep(x = "R",20)
a4<-rep(x="Stochastic Simulation",9)
a5<-rep(x="Modeling",7)
a6<-rep(x="Finance",2)
a7<-rep(x="Linear Models",6)
a8<-rep("Time Series",10)
a9<-rep("Non Life Insurance",7)
a12<-rep("Extreme Value Theory",8)
a10<-rep("Probability",11)
a11<-rep("Risk Theory",5)

N<-c(a1,a2,a3,a4,a5,a6,a7,a8,a9,a10,a11,a12)
N1<-table(N)
library(wordcloud)

wordcloud(rownames(N1),freq = c(7,3,12,3,10,2,14,9,19,28,12,11) , min.freq =1, scale=c(4, .2),colors=c("navy","blue","black","navy","grey10","navy","darkorchid4") )
